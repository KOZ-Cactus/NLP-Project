## üìå Appendix: Member Contributions

- **Buƒüra Kerem √ñzcan** developed the first model based on word embeddings and was responsible for running the reinforcement learning training phase of the third model. He also designed the overall game simulation architecture, implementing the logic for board generation, clue-guess flow, and agent interaction. Additionally, he contributed significantly to writing the final report and participated in the preparation and recording of the project video.

- **Selin Kasap** primarily contributed to the design, training, and implementation of the second model using a supervised mini transformer approach. She also added the fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to the second model and came up with the third model idea. She assisted in reinforcement learning training alongside Kerem and was actively involved in recording and editing the video presentation.

- **Ay≈üe Selin Cin** and **Mustafa Enes Erdem** both contributed to the documentation and refinement of the final project report. In addition, they played a key role in preparing the visual and narrative elements of the project video.
